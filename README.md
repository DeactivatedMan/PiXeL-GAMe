# PiXeL-GAMe
Random pixel game that uses a custom map unpacker.

To run the game, run the pixelGame.py file. Note that the game *is meant to* shut down when you finish the last level.

All maps are basic as hell, literally just a 16x16 image where rgb(255,0,0) is Goal, rgb(0,255,0) is Start, and rgb(0,0,255) is Wall.
When adding new maps, you can run the game, then press "MOD", this will open up file explorer in the map folder for you.

Check line 7 of game.py to increase (or decrease) resolution.
